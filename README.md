# 4-Bit Ripple Carry Full Adder VHDL Implementation

This repository contains VHDL code for a 4-bit ripple carry full adder. The design is modular, comprising individual components for a half adder and a full adder, which are then used to implement the 4-bit ripple carry full adder.

## Contents

- `half_adder.vhd`: VHDL code for the half adder component.
- `full_adder.vhd`: VHDL code for the full adder component.
- `main.vhd`: VHDL code for the main 4-bit ripple carry full adder implementation.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Usage

To use this VHDL implementation of the 4-bit ripple carry full adder, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a VHDL development environment set up, such as Quartus Prime Lite Edition.
2. Open the VHDL files in your development environment.
3. Simulate the design using the provided testbench to verify its functionality.
4. If necessary, modify the VHDL code to suit your specific requirements.
5. Synthesize the design for your target FPGA device. This project was developed using the 5CSEMA5F31C6 FPGA device.
